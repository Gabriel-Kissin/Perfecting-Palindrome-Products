# Perfecting-Palindrome-Products
### An introduction to basic algorithm optimisation methods.

Uses a simple and accessible problem from Project Euler as a springboard to introduce the various ways optimisation **can** be done, and when it **should & shouldn't** be done.  

No maths to speak of - just logic and optimisation.

Enjoy :-)
